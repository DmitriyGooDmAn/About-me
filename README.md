# About-me

Hi, I’m Dmytro Husakov, an aspiring IT specialist from Krakow, Poland. I have a background in management of a nightclub and restaurant, where I gained valuable skills in accounting, customer service, staff training, and event planning. I also have an unfinished higher education in economics and law from Krivoy Rog National University.

I’m currently interested in learning more about web development, especially Python, HTML, CSS, and SQL. I have completed several online courses from Sololearn, Prometheus, and Google Career Certificates to improve my knowledge and skills. I’m also studying to become a medical sterilisation technician with an additional certificate in Polish B1.

I’m looking for an internship in IT where I can apply my learning and grow as a professional. I’m open to new challenges and opportunities to work on exciting projects. I’m fluent in Russian and Ukrainian, and I have an advanced level of Polish and a basic level of English.
